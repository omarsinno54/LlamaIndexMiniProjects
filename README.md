Welcome.

This repo is my attempt at dumping random unrelated LLM mini-projects where I try out stuff I am interested in.

So far in the repo:

A. `1-getting-started`

This is the llama-index tutorial.

B. `2-guide-retrieval`

Similar to the llama-index tutorial, but making things slightly more fun by scraping data from a guide to a strategy game I enjoy playing: Total War Shogun 2. In this community created guide, some tips are given on how to build armies in the game, which settlements to focus on, and overall good strategies to win the game.

So teh difference between this section and the previous section is the scraping of data and dividing the data into several text files (a form of chunking)

Stay tuned, will be updating this repo with more quick projects!
