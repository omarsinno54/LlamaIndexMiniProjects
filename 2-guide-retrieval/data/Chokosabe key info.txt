Chokosabe start on an island with 4 provinces they want to secure first before moving on.Chokosabe have perhaps the easiest start in the game, but there is a downside.  Trade routes must connect to your capital, and Chokosabe's capital is on an island, and there are only 3-4 ports on the island, so Chokosabe can only have 3-4 trade agreements.  This issue reappeared in Warhammer 2 when Malus' Dark Elf faction capital in the Mortal Empires mode is placed on an island with no trade access, the code has never been fixed.WORKAROUND (assuming you do not use a mod that allows you to change your capital):Capture the whole island, do not build any castles higher than Tier 2.  Then conquer Bizen for the Smithing specialty, because Bizen is going to be your new capital and your main recruitment center.  Make sure it is well defended, and build the Castle to Tier 3.  Once that is done, you raise taxes to the highest level, end turn, then turn off taxes in all your provinces except your original capital which you leave taxed at the highest level, then end turn, and your original province should rebel, hopefully the rebels win and takeover, and now your new capital should be Bizen.Important Note!:  Your capital gets +1 recruitment slot, so having your capital be Bizen is even better because it will allow you to recruit more units faster.  It is a waste to have the capital be a province that will not be recruiting any units after the early game.Note:  I think rebel armies spawn stronger if you have an army in the province they are revolting in.  This info can be useful if the rebels struggle to capture the town, just have a large army within the border of the province but not in town, and the rebels should spawn strong enough to capture it.  Likewise, if you don't want the rebels to be too strong and too difficult to retake the town, don't have your army in that province.Other than that, the Chokosabe are overpowered because with Bizen, they can create +6 melee attack Bow Samurai for a total of 12 melee attack, which means they can shoot the enemy to mulch and anything that makes it into melee with the Bow Samurai will then be pulverized.Enjoy.
