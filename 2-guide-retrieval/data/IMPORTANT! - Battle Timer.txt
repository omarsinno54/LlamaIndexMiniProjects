NEVER set the battle timer to "Unlimited".  There is a bug that can occur where if multiple enemy armies attack you and they come at you one at a time and you beat the first army, the other army/armies will not reinforce and therefore if you set the timer to unlimited, you cannot win and your only choice is to forfeit and suffer defeat, which REALLY sucks when you are defending an important town.60 minutes max on the timer if you need lots of time to fight, and you can set the timer to 20 minutes if you are defending and want to be able to win by holding off the enemy until the timer expires so they automatically lose.
