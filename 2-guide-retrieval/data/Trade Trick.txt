First of all, if you did not know, you can ask the AI to give you money when you offer a trade agreement.  So not only are you benefiting from the trade, you are getting a nice chunk of change upfront as well.Warhorse Studs = Big $$$I did not know this until I saw a Reddit post about it, but apparently if you have Warhorse Studs resource, and you have a connection route to be able to trade with the AI, they could offer you tens of thousands of Koku to get a trade agreement.I would not get the trade agreement right at the start of the campaign, give the AI time to generate the money, but if you can get to the Warhorse Studs resource and have many opportunities to make new trade agreements, you could potentially set yourself up for the rest of the campaign financially doing this.
