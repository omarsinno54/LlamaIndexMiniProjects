Rule #1:  Do not try to build military buildings everywhere, you only build military buildings in the best provinces for that purpose, and the rest of your provinces should be geared toward making money.Note:  You can rotate the map, but the game start you looking at the map with south Japan to your left and north Japan to your right.  It is easy to refer to it as West-to-East, but it is actually South-to-North.  I will try to refer to it as Left-to-Right, which would be Shimazu start on the left to Date start on the right.TIP:  Shimazu, Mori and Chokosabe are great starting factions if you are new to the game, because the strategy for Shimazu is to secure their island, then conquer right until just before Realm Divide and then prepare.  The same applies to the Mori and Chokosabe, except they go left to secure Shimazu/Otomo island.  Then you post navies on either side of your territory to watch for the AI trying to sneak a fleet with a full army into your rear. http://www.wicked-chibi.ninja/region/regions_online_shogun.htmlProvinces with the "Smithing" specialty/resource are the key to easy victory in Shogun 2.  There are 5 such provinces, they are:SATSUMA (Shimazu start), BIZEN, KAGA, (one of Ikko-Ikki starting provinces), SAGAMI (Hojo start), and IWATE (Date start).In one of these provinces, you build a Master Weaponsmith for +4 melee attack and an Encampment (I think it requires tech to unlock) which you turn into a Jujutsu Dojo for +2 melee attack.You build stacks of Yari Ashigaru with +6 melee attack from that building combo, and if you increase their starting veterancy via veteran ranks from your castle and other methods, that will increase there stats further, such that you could have Yari Ashigaru with 12-17 melee attack that will beat Shimazu Katana Samurai.  Remember that Ashigaru units have more men than Samurai units as well, and they are cheaper.  If you want you can also build crazy strong Bow units or the various Samurai or Cavalry as well, but Ashigaru are the most cost effective.If you have done this, you can probably auto-resolve your battles from here on out, especially if you bring 2 stacks of Uber-Ashigaru to each field battle or siege.Cheers.
