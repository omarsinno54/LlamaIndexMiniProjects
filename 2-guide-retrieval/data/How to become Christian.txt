The most direct way to get the option to become Christian is to capture the Bungo province where the Nanban trade port is located.  This should soon prompt the message that will give you the opportunity to have your Daimyo convert to Christianity.The opportunity could come along randomly, but it is not certain enough to rely upon.For more detailed information, read the guide here on Steam "How to become Christian" by "Abraham Lincoln", it appears quite excellent, and will tell you how to actually convert your Daimyo after you get the popup.
