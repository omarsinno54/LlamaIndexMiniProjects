Rebel factions are not ambitious and will not leave their province to go conquering other provinces.  So if there is a province you do not want to deal with but obviously don't want your enemy to have, if you can get it controlled by a rebel faction, well that solves your problem.Using a Monk or Missionary can be brokenly overpowered, even Buddhist against Buddhist but especially when your religion differs from owner of the province that you want to revolt.The strategy is to move your clerics into a province, convert enough of the province (or if your clerics are leveled/skilled for conversion, the entire populace) to your religion, and then incite revolt.  If the rebel army is big enough and wins, congrats, you have removed a province from your enemy and created a non-aggressive new neighbor.  Also, I believe you can do this without declaring war, so it can be a fantastic way to let you seize new territory without going to war.Note that sometimes, especially if the province was the home base of a Clan that was destroyed, the rebel army may be rebels of that Clan, and if they win, it will revive that Clan as a faction.
