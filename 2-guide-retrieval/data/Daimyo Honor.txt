Essential Points Summarized:1) Ideal Campaign Start:  Set battle timer to 20 minutes.  Have your Daimyo and any heirs/generals besiege an enemy town while you recruit troops.  You will be building up your army while the enemy you are besieging will not be able to recruit.  End Turn.  The enemy will attack your forces, fight the battle.  Play keep away with the enemy by having your mounted Daimyo/Heir/Generals and their bodyguards run around the map so the enemy cannot kill them until the timer expires.  You win, Heroic Victory.  +1 Honor gained.  Repeat this at least 2 more times to get +3 honor while you are building up your army, then you can bring your troops to your generals and attack their lightly defended town with a full stack army.  A little boring and time consuming, but creates and excellent starting point for your campaign.2) Always cancel your treaties with another faction before you attack them so as to not get the penalty.  Unlike TW: Warhammer where you have to wait 10 turns to attack or you will become unreliable which causes huge diplomatic penalties, as long as you cancel everything before attacking another faction, which will obviously make that specific faction hate you, there does not seem to be a bad penalty with other factions for canceling treaties.3) Getting a Daimyo to 9 Honor is essential if you want to follow a strategy of looting towns a lot, because you can only lose a max of -3 honor and then no more penalties for looting, and as long as you have 6 honor, you are golden.---------------------------------Daimyo Honor.  High honor benefits you, low honor can really screw you.Daimyo with high honor = higher happiness among all regions controlled, better diplomatic relations with other clans, and increased loyalty among his generals.  Daimyo with low honor = penalties in all three (and the negative for generals can be catastrophic, a general deserting you with a full stack is no bueno, and to keep such a general in line, you have to keep a Metsuke embedded in his army, which means that Metsuke is not generating you money by being stationed in a rich province).Daimyo start with 3 honor by default. They can reach as low as 1 honor and reach as high as 6 honor (max effective honor is 6, but they can have more in reserve). Any honor penalties or bonuses after each are not counted, but apply if the honor of the daimyo goes back to within a 1-6 range.---------------------------------Negative factors for honour include:Betrayed Alliances: -1 per betrayal (max -3)>for attacking an ally or vassalTerrible losses -1 or -2 per loss (max -3)>Daimyo suffers a crushing defeatLooting -1 per loot (max -3)>looting provincesChristian Daimyo -2>Converting to christianityChristian faction -1>future daimyos of Christian clans after the daimyo that converted dies still suffer -1 penaltyDescent Into Bankruptcy -1(Max -3 temporary while bankrupt)>Allowing the treasury to reach 0 with negative income per turnEmpty Threats -1(Max -3)>Threatening someone through diplomacy and not following through with the threat after one yearPositive factors for honor include:Honourable +1(Max +2)>Learning "Honourable" in the Daimyo's skill treeTea Ceremony +1 honor/+10 to diplomatic relations>learn Tea Ceremony in the Chi ArtsVassal +1 (Max +3), permanent for current Daimyo)>Obtaining a vassalGreat victories +1 (Max +3)>Daimyo winning a heroic victoryPolite Wife +1>Married to DaimyoRumors of Treason +1>If a general's loyalty drops too low, an event sometimes triggers to have him commit seppuku.

Vassals come with benefits including being guaranteed trade partners as well as bonus income, but can drag the player into wars if other factions declare war on them. Heroic victories can be gained by exploiting the in-game clock (set timer to 20 minutes): if the enemy attacks the daimyo with a superior force, he can simply run circles on the map until time expires. Surviving the battle with zero or minimal casualties usually results in a heroic victory. This method only works, however, if the enemy does not field cavalry.Using both methods three times creates a daimyo with six honor plus three in reserve, allowing him to lose three honor without any penalty. This provides a powerful benefit:  such a daimyo can loot as many provinces as desired without suffering any drawbacks.
