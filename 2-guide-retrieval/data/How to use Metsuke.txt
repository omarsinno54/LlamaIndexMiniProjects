https://www.reddit.com/r/totalwar/comments/ej9esk/shogun_2_comprehensive_economic_guide_yes_in_2019/Just read Doccit's guide concerning Metsuke, he writes it up nicely.  Basically you put your Metsuke in your richest provinces (those that are Very Fertile or have Gold Mines) to boost the effective tax rate and thereby give you more Koku.Key Info:  if your Daimyo has low honor or a general has low loyalty but you don't want to kill him off, you can put a Metsuke in his army to keep that general inline.  But if you are following the other parts of my guide then that should never be necessary.  I never had issues with general loyalty when my Daimyo had 6 honor.
