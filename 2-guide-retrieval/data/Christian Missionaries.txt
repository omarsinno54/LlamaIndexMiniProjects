The regular monk unit, the Buddhist Monk, has many different uses, from boosting happiness or morale in towns or armies respectively, demoralizing enemy armies and inciting revolts in provinces, converting or "wounding" enemy agents, and converting the population to Buddhism.Missionaries can do pretty much the same, but their skill tree is very different, and here is my essential tip in this regard:Go straight to and all in on the skills that boost conversion to Christianity.  Your missionaries should not be used for any of that other stuff, the goal if you decide to be Christian is to get the maximum number of missionaries you can get (5 normally but there may be way to increase the cap), level them up and skill them up to where they are super apostles of preaching the Gospel (I think with enough levels and skills they could cause a +10% conversion rate per turn each or something like that, maybe more).NOTE - there may be a maximum amount that your agents can convert per turn, something like maybe 60% maybe, basically a game design intended that you have to spend at least 2 turns before you can convert a province to 100% Christianity.The goal is for you to be able to move your agents into a province, and in 2 turns, maximum 3, that province should be 100% Christian and ready happily become one of your provinces, either via conquest or inciting a revolt.
