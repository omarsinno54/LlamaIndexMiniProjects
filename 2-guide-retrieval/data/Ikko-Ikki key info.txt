Just like Christianity, as Ikko-Ikki you want to convert provinces to your religion before conquering them or inciting them to revolt.  Inciting Revolt, like stated before, can be an overpowered tool to even the odds for you.Remember that you start with Kaga, all your troops should be produced there with +6 Melee Attack as soon as you can do that.Now, I think Kaga is not the capital, they start with 2 and the other province is the capital I believe, and the capital gets +1 recruitment slots.  If this really hinders or annoys you, you can use the trick from the Chokosabe section to lose your capital and move it to Kaga.
