Wanna know how to potential move an army from one end of Japan to the other in only 1 turn via ocean movement?  It takes some preparation, but here is how:Let's say you want to move an army from the Shimazu capital to Bizen in the middle of Japan.  OK, start building Bow Kobaya in that capital provinces port.  Figure out the path your ships would take to get to Bizen if you just clicked on it.  Now, have your Kobaya move along that path ALMOST as far as it can go in one turn, but stop about a Kobaya's length short.  Next turn, you will have another Kobaya you built move to that first Kobaya's location (joining that fleet so they are in the same space), then you will click on that fleet, select one of the Kobaya, and again move that Kobaya along the path until almost its maximum range.  Repeat this process until the final Kobaya in the chain could reach the destination port.Now, you have a Kobaya ready in the starting point.  Move the army into that ship.  Now move that ship to join the first ship in the chain, which will create a fleet of 2 ships.  Select that fleet, select a ship (should be either one, or if not, select the one that still has movement points remaining), and have that 1 ship move along to the next ship in the chain.  The army will go with the ship that has movement points.  Rinse and repeat, and you can move the army along the chain of ships until it reaches the destination port, all in 1 turn!
